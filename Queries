3. There is no mention of currencies in amounts, do we support any specific currency/currencies ?
4. Timezones are not specified, as of now assumption is local time is used.

i.e. irrespective of zone - e.g. first ride from zone1 to zone1, secnod from zone1 to zone1, third from zone3 to zone3. On next ride cap would be applied
OR
first,second ride from zone1 to zone1, third from zone2 to zone3, fourth from zone1 to zone1
now three rides for zone1 to zone1 travel are done, cap is applicable for next one
